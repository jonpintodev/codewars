// Your function takes two arguments:

// current father's age (years)
// current age of his son (years)
// Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).

//P: two numbers (fathers age and sons age)
//R: number value of how many years ago the father was twice as old as the son
//E:
//P:

const twiceAsOld = (dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) => Math.abs(dadYearsOld - sonYearsOld * 2)
